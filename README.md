# Craft Overflow Fieldtype

The Overflow fieldtype adds a "character count" indicator to the standard Craft `PlainText` fieldtype. The counter can be used to display the number of characters entered out of a recommended total, or the number of characters remaining.

If the user enters more characters than the recommended limit, the counter text turns red.
